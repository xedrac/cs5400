Build Instructions:
=============================
- Extract the source code from the tarball
- Enter the "build" directory and run "cmake .." to generate the build system
- For Linux/MacOS, just run 'make -j4' to compile
- For Windows, a Visual Studio project file is generated
- Run the game

- Note: If using Windows, CMake often has trouble finding GLEW and GLUT paths,
        so you may need to modify the CMakeLists.txt file and tell cmake where
        those packages.  One way to do this is to uncomment the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
        line and point it to the directory where these exist

Game Controls:
==============================
- WASD to move the player spaceship around
- Left mouse click to fire standard projectiles
- Right mouse click to fire large projectiles
- Middle mouse click to fire obscenely large projectiles (only for really handicapped players)

Camera Controls:
==============================
- Mouse wheel to zoom camera in and out
- While holding 'I', move mouse to pitch/yaw camera
- Note that camera movement is somewhat restricted (cannot look beyond [-90, +90] degrees)
