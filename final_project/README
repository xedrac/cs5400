Build Instructions:
=============================
- Extract the source code

- From the source directory, run the command "cmake ."  (don't forget the dot!)
- For Linux/MacOS, just run 'make' to compile
- For Windows, a Visual Studio project file is generated (untested!  may need to change library names)
- Run the 'render' program (must be run from the source tree and not some other directory)
