Build Requirements:
---------------------
    cmake
    c++11 compiler
    glut
    glew


Build Instructions:
---------------------
- Extract the source code

- From the source directory, run the command "cmake ."  (don't forget the dot!)
  Optionally, you can create a directory called 'build' and from it, run "cmake .."
  This will confine all generated build files to this directory, and not clutter
  up the source tree

- For Linux/MacOS, just run 'make' to compile

- For Windows, a Visual Studio project file is generated 

- Run the program 'mountain'
